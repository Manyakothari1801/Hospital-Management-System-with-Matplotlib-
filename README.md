# Hospital Management System (Python + MySQL + Matplotlib)

## Overview
This project is an academic software application developed as part of the Informatics Practices course. It demonstrates how Python programming can be applied to solve real-world problems in healthcare management by replacing manual, paper-based processes with a digital system.

The system supports basic hospital operations such as user registration, login, managing doctor records, and visualizing hospital data using graphs.

## Aim
To apply programming concepts and software development skills to build a real-world application and demonstrate the use of databases, logic, and visualization in a practical system. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Features
- User registration and login system  
- Doctor record management (add, delete, view details)  
- MySQL database connectivity using `mysql.connector`  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib bar charts  
- Menu-driven terminal interface  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- MySQL (mysql.connector)  
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)  
- Random, Time modules  
- Turtle (used in package exploration)  

## Sample Visualizations
The project includes bar graphs such as:
- Number of patients visiting doctors at different times  
- Number of doctors per specialization  
- Distribution of disease cases  
(Shown in report outputs) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What I Learned
- Python programming fundamentals  
- Working with MySQL databases  
- Writing menu-driven programs  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib  
- Applying programming to real-world use cases
